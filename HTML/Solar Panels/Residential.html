            <p>
                A typical rooftop solar power system has electricity-generating photovoltaic panels, commonly known as solar panels, on top of a house or building. But there is much more to it. Solar panel is comprised of multiple PV (photovoltaic) cells that convert sunshine to electricity. Two types of PV Panels are there – while one comprise of “Polycrystalline Cells”, the other one contains “Monocrystalline Cells”. Based on the area available for solar installation, the required capacity of solar panels can be calculated. Call our solar expert to know your solar potential and get your solar journey started.

            <h1 >On-Grid System or Grid-tied System</h1>
            <p>
                These systems are designed to work in conjunction with the grid or simply put your electricity supply. The electricity you generate using this system is fed back to the grid. A net meter is installed along with this system to keep track of the electricity consumed by you versus what you generated and fed back to the grid resulting in savings which gets reflected in the bill. It does not work when the grid is down.            </p>

            <h1 >Off-Grid System</h1>
            <p>
                These systems store the electricity produced by conversion in batteries and utilise the stored energy by converting it back to AC as and when required. The rising cost of other power sources and the increasing demand of electricity, especially in high power cut or no grid areas, has resulted in increased demand for such systems. The reduction in battery prices over the years has further brought the system cost down.            </p>
