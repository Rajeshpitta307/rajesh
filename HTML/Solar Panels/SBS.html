            <p>
                Solar batteries are one of the crucial components as they allow you to store the electricity generated by the solar plant and use it in case of power outages or in case of no mains. A good battery would be the one which gives long back up and requires very less maintenance (less frequent water top-up).

Our batteries specially designed for longer backup time and long life. Our Solar Batteries are low maintenance batteries and require low water top up. They deliver upto 30% more power than normal C20 rated batteries and comes under industry leading warranty of upto 5 years.
