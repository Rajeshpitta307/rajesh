                Commercial solar panels are an array of multiple photovoltaic (PV) solar panels that convert sunlight into electricity. Photovoltaic (PV) solar panels comprise of solar cells made from silicon that is constructed with a positive layer and a negative layer, which together create an electric field. Multiple cells make up a solar panel, and multiple panels or modules can be wired together to form a solar array. Commercial solar panels employ a large number of solar arrays to generate more electricity. These can be installed on the top of buildings and generate enough energy to meet the buildingâ€™s power needs. Commercial solar panels are sources of clean and renewable energy that require very little maintenance and has no carbon emissions which has become a global concern.
