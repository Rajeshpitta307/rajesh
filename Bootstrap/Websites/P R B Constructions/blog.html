        <h1 class="themecolor">Why are more people showing interest to live in communities than individual houses?<br>
          of constructing excellence</h1>
        <div class="emptyspace-20"></div>
        <p>Individual houses have been the way of living until a couple of decades when the gated communities have come into existence on a larger scale. People are being exposed to many more number of communities, varying to ones budget scale, and the benefits of them eventually. A plethora of communities have developed on the outskirts of the city in a trice. </p>
        <p>Now a days, people are becoming more and more selective about the neighbourhood they want to live in. They are definitely making a conscious choice when it comes to the upbringing of their kids in particular localities. </p>
        <p>Gated communities are favoured and admired due to many reasons. To list a few we can consider the following.</p>
        <p>1. Security<br>
          2. Play areas<br>
          3. Greenery<br>
          4. Pollution free<br>
          5. Amenities<br>
          6. Service helpers<br>
        </p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong><br>
          <br>
          The paramount thing for each and every person when it comes to deciding the area of their residence is definitely safety and security.<br>
          A gated community majorly sells for this reason. Every community has its own way of providing security.<br>
          Professional Security guards are hired on shifts basis, electric fencing is used in certain communities to keep a check from all the four directions of community. Now a days a new app has come into rescue too. Its called Mygate app. This app helps us keep a track on every single detail i.e., from visitors to maid’s attendance. A message or permission request is prompted when ever the maids enter and exit, when ever there is a delivery or courier respectively. This is very suitable for gated communities, villas, row houses, group houses etc.<br>
          Security in a community doesn’t limit itself to the protection from gaurds or other forms, even the friendly neighbors provide with emergency help like taking care of the kids when needed. For instance, when my friend’s father in law had experienced a sudden chest pain and had to be taken to hospital, she needed someone to take care of her 2 yr old kid. It was easy for her to drop her infant at her neighbor without any second thoughts about his safety. Even the kids can play around without constant supervision as they are safely gaurded with securities on gates and also with so many familiar people around in the community.</p>
        <p><strong>Play areas</strong><br>
          <br>
          Every community now a days is fabricated in expansive areas. It helps in providing a place with solace from infants to elderly people. This includes the most important thing, Play areas. Individual houses lack this opportunity massively. Kids of all groups have access to the play areas in the community. They have a park with slides, swings and other rides for fun. They also have sand pits where toddlers can enjoy for hours together. Volley ball, throw ball, shuttle courts are also provided in certain communities. Some communities also provide special coaching classes for shuttle/cricket/throw ball, this majorly helps parents who can’t take their kids outside for classes. Kids can go their own and come back home safely. Kids may also show more interest if classes are taken at door step. </p>
        <p><strong>Swimming pool</strong><br><br>
          Most of the communities which are built in a vast area have swimming pools built in them. This is one the most fun addition to a community. Especially to people who love swimming or who want to learn swimming, irrespective of their age, can use this amenity. Coaches are also hired to teach and help kids, adults learn it like a pro. Best technology is used to maintain the pool water. It is always kept very hygienic and ready to use throughout the year. Pool side parties can also be planned without much of an effort. Swimmin competitions can also be held in the community as a part of any event.</p>
        <p><strong>Greenery and Pollution free</strong><br><br>
          Every community’s vital priority is its ambience, atmosphere and environment. Special care is taken when it comes to planting trees, maintaining the greenery around. Usually the communities are built on the outskirts of the city, that itself makes the atmosphere very pleasant and peaceful, away from the pollution noise and traffic. People crave for such places which helps them breath fresh air. The trees and plants in the community uplifts the mood of the residents and also improves their overall health. A morning or evening walk admist of this kind nature will help deal with stress, overweight and helps in leading a healthy and happy life both physically and emotionally. The communities hire special help for maintenance of it. Roads are cleaned and kept neatly every day. Kids also enjoy such ambience and can be carefree while playing around. The dust or wastage is also collected, from the door step, weekly twice to keep dirt and bugs at bay. Highly recommended for people who want to reside in a pollution free zone. </p>
        <p><strong>Amenities</strong><br><br>
          Gated communities are well equipped with many aids. Listing down a few.,<br><br>
          Roads, street lights, play areas, water connection, electricity, park, club house, gym, game courts, supermarkets, fruit and vegetable vendors on weekly basis, pet friendly atmosphere, power back up, 24/7 help etc.<br><br>
          Roads are pretty wide and are maintained on a daily basis with consistent speed breakers to control the speed of the vehicles. Street lights help residents to move around in the nights, especially kids who go out to play can return without any fear even after dusk.<br><br>
          24/7 Water connection is provided in any community. Any water issues are fixed by the management of the society which keeps us away from that little bother or worry about the regular water inflow. Some Communities also provide solar connections for water and electricity, this majorly helps in reduction of our variable expenses. Residents needn’t worry about turning on geezers etc for hot water every single time. They just have to open the tap for hot water and there it is.<br><br>
          24/7 Electricity is available here and generator back ups are also provided whenever there is a power cut. Hence like in an individual house we needn’t strain about installing an inverter and maintainin it.<br><br>
          Parks are very well maintained for usage of all age groups. People can go for their morning or evening walks, kids can play around safely and elderly people can catch up with their peer group in the evenings.<br><br>
          Club houses in any community help for planning group tutions, small gatherings, festival traditions, community meetings, birthday parties, new year parties, games, any dance/yoga/music classes etc. They are very well vested with all the required comforts for the above mentioned events. For example, wash rooms, food serving sections, stage, music systems etc. Club house also has a gym which helps people the community to maintain there fitness without travelling for it. They can walk to the gym, finish there work out with all the widely arranged equipments without any fuss. Large communities also have Super markets and vegetable/fruit vendors which cater to the needs of the residents. They can lead a peaceful routine without running around much for the regular errands and groceries.<br><br>
          Many communities encourage having pets. They provide a very pet friendly atmosphere. Dogs, cats and many other pets can be maintained without any issues.<br><br>
          Any gated community provides 24/7 help. There are people who are available at a call. Security is right there to help any time. Even the neighbor look out for each other irrespective of time.</p>
        <p><strong>Service helpers</strong><br><br>
          It includes maids, electricians, plumbers, gardeners, dry cleaning service, cleaners, cooks etc. Maids are easily available in a community as they also have a wide choice and make good money by working in more than two houses as per their capacity. Just in case one maid needs an off, substitute for her is quickly available. Electricians, plumbers and gardeners come on a weekly basis and whoever needs their service can schedule it on that particular day or they come down as and when there is urgent need too. People come to the door step and collect clothes for dry cleaning and pressing and deliver the same too. Cooks are also available at a call away in any community without much of hunting for them. Milk man from the close by village also comes down every day and pours organic milk saving us the time and energy otheriwse. Garbage is also picked weekly twice from our door step. Dry waste is also picked up separately every week. This only encourages us to segregate wet/dry waste and help the environment.<br><br>
          In addition to the above, there are many advantages of the living in a community, for example., it is easy to find peer groups for different ages of people. The homemakers can find their own peer group and plan on some activities for fun like kitty and for constructive purposes too like a small start up etc. Kids have many friends and mingling with them helps kids share, adjust and adapt to different mentalities. Elderly people can find their own company for walks or chit chats to entertain themselves. Men can find their work-out partners too. Tutitions, drawing, crafts, baking etc., classes are also taken by some people within the community, therefore it helps parents who can’t take their kids outside for it. Kids can go all by themselves and return back safely.<br>
          Overall, there are innumerable benefits of residing in a community than a individual house. It always is a wiser decision to choose a gated community over an individual house to live in.</p>
